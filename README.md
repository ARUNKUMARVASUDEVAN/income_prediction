# ðŸ“ˆ Adult Census Income Prediction 

The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the income level of adults based on various demographic, educational, and occupational features. The model should analyze a given individual's characteristics and provide a prediction of whether their income exceeds a certain threshold, such as $50,000 per year.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

NumPy
Pandas
matplotlib
scikit-learn


## Classification Models Used:
ðŸ¤– Decision Tree

ðŸ¤– Logistic Regression

ðŸ¤– Random Forests

ðŸ¤– k-Nearest Neighbours

ðŸ¤– Support Vector Machine

Creating  A virtual Environment

         conda create -p venv python=3.8


## Result
After cleaning and preparing the data for the models, cross-validation has been done and other operations to compare between the models.

Finally, The Random Forest Classifier has been chosen, for achieving very high results in terms of evaluation metrics. A 93% accuracy score, also the same result for F1-score.
